i dont know if its the best idea to make it so the player doesnt have a cursor when
the rule is broken but i just think its kinda funny.

importnat: the game doesnt work if the cursor is deleted at the end.

i guess next thing is the planet logic but screw that honestly.

maybe revert so its back to preload ???

timer.cs type compomenet or repeatingcall type beat maybe.
